      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/Profile.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Vincent Dang">

      <p>In Savannah, GA, born but not raised.  On the playgorounds of Atlanta is where I spent most of my days.  In 1983, as soon as my parents arrived in the U.S., I was born.  My parents left Vietnam after the war, in search of a better life for our family.  </p>
      <p>My father served in the military most of his life.  From what I know, my parents are far more braver than I am or ever will be.  After I was born, my father moved our family to Stamford, CT, where he was attending college.  We lived here for about 13 years and decided that we had enough of the cold weather.  </p>
      <p>Soon after the 1996 Summer Olympics, we moved to Atlanta.  I am a son, a younger brother to an older sister, a husband, and a new-found father.  I am currently trying my best to be better than my parents.  Not because I'm competitive but because it's what my parents wanted for their kids, when they risked their lives and hopped on a boat.</p>
      <p>I took the scenic route and majored in Business Marketing, Computer Infomation Systems, and Sociology before leaving Georgia State University.  I am currently pursuing this program to rid my life of rush hour traffic, in order to be able to spend more time with my son and future children.  I am super excited to be enrolled in this program and can't wait to see where it will take me; as long as we don't take I-285 at 8am, during the weekdays!</p>
